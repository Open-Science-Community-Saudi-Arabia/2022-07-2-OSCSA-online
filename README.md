# The Carpentries Workshop 2022-07-2-OSCSA-online

The workshop is organised by the Open Science Community Saudi Arabia. It’ll be delivered by instructors and facilitators from and Saudi Society for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (SSBCB), ArabR and Carpentries in MENA

This lesson will introduce you to open data science using R, RStudio and GitHub so you can work with data in an open, reproducible, and collaborative way. “Open data science” means that methods, data, and code are available so that others can access, reuse, and build from it without much fuss. Here you will learn a workflow with R, RStudio, git and GitHub. A great deal of this lesson is based on a publication by Lowndes et al. 2017, Nature Ecology & Evolution: Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools and on the Ocean Health Index book - Introduction to Open Data Science.

This is going to be fun, because learning these open data science tools and good practices is empowering! This training material is written (and continously upgraded) so you can use it as self-paced learning, or it can be used to teach an in-person workshop where the instructor live codes. Either way, you should do everything hands-on on your own computer as you learn
